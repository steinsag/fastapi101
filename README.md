## Initial setup

This project uses package manager [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage dependencies.

    uv sync

## Verify (format, lint, type-check, tests)

One command to auto-fix formatting/lints, run type checks, and tests:

      uv run scripts/verify.py

This runs, in order: `black .`, `ruff check --fix .`, `ty check`, `pytest`.

## Code formatting (Black)

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used for code formatting.

Check formatting:

      uv run black --check .

Auto-format the code locally:

      uv run black .

## Linting (Ruff)

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) enforces common Python lint rules and import sorting.

Run Ruff for the whole project:

    uv run ruff check .

Optionally, to auto-fix what Ruff can fix:

    uv run ruff check . --fix

## Static type checking (ty)

[ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) is used for static type checking.

Run ty for the whole project:

    uv run ty check

## Running tests (with coverage)

Pytest is configured to generate coverage reports automatically via pytest-cov.

Run tests:

    uv run pytest

After the run you'll get:

- Terminal coverage summary (missing lines shown, skip-covered enabled)
- HTML report in htmlcov/index.html
- XML report in coverage.xml

## Git pre-commit hooks

Enable the repository-managed pre-commit hook so that linters and formatters run before each commit:

    git config core.hooksPath .githooks

What it does:
- Runs ty: `uv run ty check`
- Runs Ruff lint: `uv run ruff check .`
- Runs Black in check mode: `uv run black --check .`
- Blocks the commit if linting, formatting, or typing issues are found

To bypass the hook: `git commit --no-verify`

## Creating and running a Docker container

Build the container:

    docker build -t fastapi101

Run the container:

    docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi101

The app is listening on port 8000 locally. Try: http://localhost:8000/items/5?q=somequery
